# IS557 MLTP
This repository holds my code for IS557 Applied Machine Learning: Team Project

## Unsupervised learning
This folder holds my code for the first preliminary individual project, in which I will use unsupervize learning to discover clusters among tweets from 16 Twitter (now X :)) account (Karami,Amir. (2018). Health News in Twitter. UCI Machine Learning Repository. [https://doi.org/10.24432/C5BW2Q](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5BW2Q). 

- visualization.py: process the files and visualize the probability of occurrence for the 10 most common words from each Twitter account
- clustering.py: perform k-means clustering (k=16) on the vectorized tweets and bulid a decision tree model to explain the clustering results
- CH-index.py: vary number of clusters to observe the change in quality of clustering
